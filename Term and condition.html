        <center><h2>TERM & CONDITIONS</h2></center>
        <h2>ROLE OF HOTEL EMBLEM AND LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF HOTEL EMBLEM</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>Hotel Emblem acts as a facilitator and merely provides an online platform to the User to select and book a 
        particular hotel. Hotels in this context includes all categories of accommodations such as hotels, home-
        stays, bed and breakfast stays, farm-houses and any other alternate accommodations.</li><br>
        <li>All the information pertaining to the hotel including the category of the hotel, images, room type, 
            amenities and facilities available at the hotel are as per the information provided by the Hotel Emblem. 
            This information is for reference only. Any discrepancy that may exist between the website 
            pictures and actual settings of the hotel shall be raised by the User with the hotel directly, and 
            shall be resolved between the User and hotel. Hotel Emblem will have no responsibility in that process of 
            resolution, and shall not take any liability for such discrepancies.</li><br><br></ul>
            <h2>INFORMATION FROM THE HOTEL AND THE TERMS OF THE HOTEL</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>The hotel booking voucher which Hotel Emblem issues to a User is solely based on the information provided 
            or updated by the hotel regarding the inventory availability. In no circumstances can Hotel Emblem be 
            held liable for failure on part of a hotel to accommodate the User with a confirmed booking, the 
            standard of service or any insufficiency in the services, or any other service related issues at 
            the hotel. The liability of Hotel Emblem in case of denial of check-in by a hotel for any reason what-
            so-ever including over-booking, system or technical errors, or unavailability of rooms etc., will 
            be limited to either providing a similar alternate accommodation at the discretion of Hotel Emblem 
            (subject to availability at that time), or refunding the booking amount (to the extent paid) to 
            the User. Any other service related issues should be directly resolved by the User with the hotel.</li><br>
            <li>Hotels reserves the sole right of admission and Hotel Emblem has no say whatsoever in admission or denial 
            for admission by the hotel. Unmarried or unrelated couples may not be allowed to check-in by some 
            hotels as per their policies. Similarly, accommodation may be denied to guests posing as a couple if
            suitable proof of identification is not presented at the time check-in. Some hotels may also not 
            allow local residents to check-in as guests. Hotel Emblem will not be responsible for any check-in denied
            by the hotel due to the aforesaid reasons or any other reason not under the control of Hotel Emblem. No 
            refund would be applicable in case the hotel denies check-in under such circumstances.</li><br><br></ul>

            <ul>
            <li>The User would be liable to make good any damage(s) caused by any act of him/ her/ or their 
            accompanying guests (willful/negligent) to the property of the hotel in any manner whatsoever. 
            The extent and the amount of the damage so caused would be determined by the concerned hotel. 
            Hotel Emblem would not, in any way, intervene in the same.</li><br>
            <li>The primary guest must be at least 18 years old to be able to check into the hotel.</li><br>
            <li>The User has to be in possession of a valid identity proof and address proof, at the time of 
            check-in. The hotel shall be within its rights to deny check-in to a User if a valid identity proof 
            is not presented at the time of check-in.</li><br>
            <li>Check-in time, check-out time, and any changes in those timings, will be as per hotel policy & terms.
             Early check-in or late check-out request is subject to availability and the hotel may charge an 
             additional fee for providing such services.</li><br><br></ul>
             <h2>ADDITIONAL CHARGES BY THE HOTEL</h2>
             <ul>
             <li>The booking amount paid by the User is only for stay at the hotel. Some bookings may include 
            breakfast and/ or meals as confirmed at the time of booking. Any other services utilized by 
            the User at the hotel, including laundry, room service, internet, telephone, extra food, drinks, 
            beverages etc. shall be paid by the User directly to the hotel.</li><br>

                Eve or other festivals as decided by the hotel. All additional charges (including mandatory meal 
                surcharges) need to be cleared directly at the hotel. Hotel Emblem will have no control over waiving the 
                same.</li><br><br></ul> 
            <h2>PAYMENT FOR BOOKINGS AND ANY ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS</h2>
            <ul>
            <li>Booking of a hotel can either be “Prepaid”, or “Pay at hotel” as per the options made available by
             a hotel on the Website of Hotel Emblem.</li><br>
             <li>In “Prepaid” model, the total booking amount is paid by the User at the time of booking itself. 
            Such total booking amount includes the hotel reservation rate, taxes, service fees as may be charged on
         behalf of the actual service provider, and any additional booking fee or convenience fee charged by Hotel Emblem.</li><br>
         <li>At the hotel’s or Hotel Emblem’s sole discretion on case to case basis, the User may also be provided with
         an option to make a part payment to Hotel Emblem at the time of confirmation of a booking. The balance booking 
         amount shall be paid as per the terms of the bookings. For security purposes, the User must provide Hotel Emblem
          with correct credit or debit card details. Hotel Emblem may cancel the booking at its sole discretion in case 
          such bank or credit card details as provided by the User are found incorrect.</li><br>
          <li>Some banks and card issuing companies charge their account holders a transaction fee when the card 
            issuer and the merchant location (as defined by the card brand, e.g. Visa, MasterCard, American Express) 
            are in different countries. If a User has any questions about the fees or any exchange rate applied, they 
            may contact their bank or the card issuing company through which payment was made.</li><br>
            <li>Some accommodation suppliers may require User and/or the other persons, on behalf of whom the 
                booking is made, to present a credit card or cash deposit upon check-in to cover additional 
                expenses that may be incurred during their stay. Such deposit is unrelated to any payment received 
                by Hotel Emblem and solely at the behest of the Hotel.</li><br>
        <li>In “Pay at hotel” model, the concerned hotel will collect the entire payment against the booking at the 
            time of check-in. In case of international bookings, the payment will be charged in local currency or 
            in any other currency, as decided by the hotel. For security purposes, the User must provide Hotel Emblem 
            with correct credit or debit card details. Hotel Emblem may cancel the booking at its sole discretion in 
            case such bank or credit card details as provided by the User are found incorrect.</li><br><br></ul>
            <h2>PAYMENT FOR BOOKINGS AND ANY ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS</h2>

                    links or any linked website pages to the extent such information is updated or provided directly
                     by the Service Providers or the advertisers.</li><br>
